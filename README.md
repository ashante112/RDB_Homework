# Excel Challenge - Kickstart My Chart

Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success.  For this challenge, I will organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.

<b>Bonus:</b>

Create a line chart that graphs the relationship between a goal's amount and its chances at success, failure or cancellation.

If one were to describe a successful crowdfunding campaign, most people would use the number of campaign backers as a metric of success. One of the most efficient ways that data scientists characterize a quantitiative metric, such as the number of campaign backers, is by creating a summary statistics table.

I will evaluate the number of backers of successful and unsuccessful campaigns by creating my own summary statistics table.
